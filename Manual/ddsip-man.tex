\section{Introduction}
Â \texttt{ddsip} is a C-implementation of a number of scenario decomposition algorithms for two-stage
stochastic linear programs with mixed-integer recourse. It expects a MIP, stochastic LPs are not supported.\\
The program is based on a previous Fortran~90-implementation
of C.C. Car\o e. Main idea of the decomposition algorithms is the Lagrangian relaxation of the
non\-anti\-ci\-pa\-tivity constraints and a branch-and-bound algorithm to reestablish
non\-anti\-ci\-pa\-tivity. The original scenarios decomposition algorithm has been developed in
\cite{cs1}. Extensions including the treatment of mean-risk models have been made in \cite{diss}. 

For the dual optimization we use \texttt{ConicBundle} -- a C$^{++}$-implementation kindly provided by
C. Helmberg, see \cite{CB}. We use the CPLEX callable library to solve the mixed-integer subproblems in
the branch-and-bound tree, see \cite{cp}. The current version of \texttt{ddsip} is ready for CPLEX~12.6.3
and requires at least version 11.2.

The implementation features risk minimization, too. This version supports mean-risk models involving
the risk measure {\it expected excess of a target} (see \cite{og}, here: {\it expected shortfall below
target}), {\it excess probabilities} (as investigated in \cite{tied}), {\it absolute semideviation},
{\it worst-case-costs}, {\it tail value-at-risk}, {\it value-at-risk}, and {\it standard deviation}.

The code is of research quality, i.e. no production quality should be expected with respect to stability
and efficiency.
We kindly ask the user to support us fixing bugs by reporting them to us as they occur.

We did not %yet 
include support for the SMPS format, but a rather basic input format is implemented, which
is not very handy with stochastic matrix entries. Any contributions in this respect are welcome.
Our code only supports the scenario formulation.

This manual describes the format of the input files and the data contained in the output
files of \texttt{ddsip}. We try to provide all necessary information on the input parameters.

\section{Stochastic programs with mixed-integer re\-course}
This implementation is appropriate to solve {\it recourse models}. Such problems
were first investigated by \cite{dant} and \cite{beal}. The conceptual idea behind recourse models is the
following; assume the decisions are two-stage in the sense that some of them, say $x$, have to
be taken immediately whilst others, say $y$, may be delayed to a time when uncertainty has revealed. We
can write a random linear program of this type as
%
\begin{equation} \label{E:TWOSTAGE}
\inf_{x \in X,\,y(\omega) \in \R^m_\+} \{c(\omega)x + q(\omega) y(\omega) \st T(\omega)x +
W(\omega)y(\omega) = h(\omega)\}.
\end{equation}
%
The random parameter $\xi:=(c,q,T,W,h):\Omega \tends \R^n \times \R^m \times \Rsn \times \Rsm
\times \R^s$ is defined on the probability space $(\Omega,\Prob,\mathcal{A})$. The set $X \subset
\{x \in \R_\+^n: Ax = b\}$ contains all deterministic constraints on $x$. Inequality constraints can
be handled in (\ref{E:TWOSTAGE}) by the introduction of appropriate slack variables. 
The model (\ref{E:TWOSTAGE}) is also referred to as {\it two-stage model}. 

We note that the problem (\ref{E:TWOSTAGE}) is not yet well-defined. As the constraints include
random parameters, the meaning of feasibility
and thus of optimality is not clear. We complete the recourse model by adding an objective function
criterion. Before we do so, we rewrite problem (\ref{E:TWOSTAGE}) as
%
\begin{equation} 
\inf_{x \in X} \{c(\omega)x + \phi(x,\omega)\}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation} 
\phi(x,\omega)=\inf_{y \in \R^m_\+} \{q(\omega) y \st T(\omega)x + W(\omega) y = h(\omega) \}.
\end{equation}
%
We note that, provided $\phi: \R^n \times \Omega$ is measurable, we can
regard $\mathcal{Z}:=\{c(\omega)x+ \tilde \phi(x,\omega) : x \in X\}$ as a family of random
variables. Now, each function $\RI: \mathcal{Z} \to \R$, \eg the expected value, some measure of
risk, or a weighted sum of both, can serve as objective criterion
%
\begin{equation} \label{E:TWOSTAGE-}
\inf_{x \in X} \RI[c(\omega)x + \tilde \phi(x,\omega)].
\end{equation}
%
Our focus is on integer models, \ie in addition to the constraints employed in problem
\eqref{E:TWOSTAGE} we may have integrality requirements on the variables $x$ and $y$.
Note that models with a linear second stage should be dealt with a version of the
{\it L-shaped algorithm}, see \cite{bir}.

We briefly discuss the implemented algorithm for the expected value case, \ie 
$$\RI[c(\omega)x + \tilde \phi(x,\omega)]  = \E[c(\omega)x + \tilde \phi(x,\omega)] := \int_\Omega
c(\omega)x + \tilde \phi(x,\omega) \P d \omega. $$ 
Further algorithms suitable for the treatment of mean-risk models are described in \cite{diss}.

Assume we
are given a finite number of scenarios $\xi_j$, $j=1,\ldots,S$, with corresponding 
probabilities $\pi_j$. Then, problem \eqref{E:TWOSTAGE-} turns into 
%
\begin{equation} \label{E:EDISCRETE}
\min_{x \in X,\,y_j\in \ZtiRp} \{ c_j x + \sum_{j=1}^S \pi_j q_j y_j \st T_jx +W_j y_j = h_j, \quad
\forall j\},  
\end{equation}
%
cf. \cite{bir}, \cite{kal}, and \cite{pre}. The so-called expected recourse function $\QE$ reads
%
\begin{equation*} 
\QE(x)= c_j x + \min_{y_j\in \ZtiRp} \{ \sum_{j=1}^S \pi_j q_j y_j \st T_jx +W_j y_j = h_j, \quad \forall j\},  
\end{equation*}
%
for all $x \in \R^n$.
The program (\ref{E:EDISCRETE}) is a large-scale deterministic mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
with a block-angular 
structure. A recent and comprehensive overview of existing algorithms for problem
\eqref{E:EDISCRETE} is provided in \cite{louv}. To mention some of the algorithmic approaches we refer to 
\cite{vdvl} for simple recourse models ($W=(I,-I)$), to \cite{lapo} for two-stage models
with a binary first stage, and to \cite{ahme} for models with an integer second stage and a fixed
technology matrix $T$. An
algorithm  for problem \eqref{E:EDISCRETE} in its general form has been proposed in \cite{cs1}. It
works on the expense of a branching on continuous first-stage variables. The latter algorithm is
implemented in \texttt{ddsip} and described in what follows.

By introducing copies of the first-stage variables, an equivalent formulation of (\ref{E:EDISCRETE})
is given by  
%
\begin{equation} \label{E:COPIES}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x_j,y_j}&\{\sum_{j=1}^S \pi_j(c_j x_j+q_j y_j) \st x_1=\ldots=x_S, \, (x_j,y_j) \in M_j,\,\forall j\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $M_j=\{(x_j,y_j):T_jx_j+W_j y_j = h_j, x_j \in X, y_j \in Y \},\; j=1,\ldots,S. $

Considering the constraint matrix of (\ref{E:COPIES}) (cf. Figure~\ref{F:CM2}),
we can identify $S$ single-scenario subproblems solely coupled by  the equality ({\it
non\-an\-ti\-ci\-pa\-ti\-vi\-ty}\/)   
constraints on the copies of the first-stage variables and written as $\sum_{j=1}^S H_jx_j=0$, where
$H=(H_1,\ldots,H_j)$. The problem decomposes when we relax the non\-an\-ti\-ci\-pa\-ti\-vi\-ty
constraints.

Upper bounds on the optimal value can be obtained by heuristics based on the
solutions for the subproblems. We get a lower bound by solving the Lagrangian
dual, which is a nonlinear concave maximization  
%
\begin{equation} \label{E:EXLADU}
\begin{aligned}
z_\tLD:=\max_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^l}  \min_{x_j,y_j} &\{ \sum_{j=1}^S \pi_j(c_jx_j+q_jy_j)+\lambda
 \sum_{j=1}^S H_j x_j \st (x_j,y_j) \in M_j,\,\forall j\}. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
In general, the involved integrality
restrictions lead to an optimality gap. If we are not satisfied with the
bounds given by the above method, we can elaborate a branch-and-bound algorithm that
successively reestablishes the equality of the components of the first-stage
vector. Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote a list of problems.
\vspace{2ex}

\noindent
\texttt{Algorithm} \texttt{SD}: Scenario decomposition (\cite{cs1})
\begin{enumerate}[{\em STEP 1}]
\item Initialization: Set $z^*= \infty$ and let $\mathcal{P}$ consist of
problem (\ref{E:EDISCRETE}). 
\item Termination: If $\mathcal{P}=\emptyset$ then $x^*$ with $z^*=\QE(x^*)$ is optimal.
\item Node selection: Select and delete a problem $P$ from $\mathcal{P}$ and solve
its Lagrangian dual. If the associated optimal value $z_{\tLD}(P)$ equals infinity
(infeasibility of a subproblem) go to {\em STEP 2}.  
\item Bounding: If $z_{\tLD}(P)$ is greater than $z^*$ go to {\em STEP 2}. 
Otherwise proceed as follows; if the first-stage solutions $x_j,\,j=1,\ldots,S,$ of the subproblems
are 
\vspace{-.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] identical, then set $z^*:=\min\{z^*,\QE(x_j)\}$, delete all $P' \in \mathcal{P}$ with $z_{\tLD}(P') \ge
z^*$ and go to {\em STEP 2}.
\item[--] not identical, then compute a suggestion $\hat x := Heu(x_1,\ldots,x_S)$ using 
some heuristic. Set $z^*:=\min\{z^*,\QE(\hat x)\}$ and delete all $P'
\in \mathcal{P}$ with $z_{\tLD}(P') \ge z^*$. 
\end{itemize}
\item Branching: Select a component $x_{(k)}$ of $x$ and add two new problems to
$\mathcal{P}$ that differ from $P$ by the additional constraint $x_{(k)} \le
\lfloor x_{(k)} \rfloor$ and $x_{(k)} \ge \lfloor x_{(k)} \rfloor + 1$,
respectively, if $x_{(k)}$ is integer, or   $x_{(k)} \le x_{(k)} - \varepsilon$
and $x_{(k)} \ge x_{(k)} + \varepsilon$, respectively, if $x_{(k)}$ is
continuous. $\varepsilon > 0$ has to be chosen such that the two new problems
have disjoint subdomains. Go to {\em STEP 3}. 
\end{enumerate}
%In {\em STEP 6} ~the second-stage solutions $y^R_j$ are obtained by solving the $S$ problems
%(\ref{E:SSFIX}) with a fix first-stage variable $\hat x$. 
The algorithm is
finite if $X$ is bounded and if some stopping criterion is employed that prevents the algorithm from  
endless branching on the continuous components of $x$, see \cite{cs1}.

The function $\QE$ is evaluated at $x$ by fixing the first stage to $x$, solving the scenario many
subproblems, and calculating the expected value of the corresponding optimal values. Thus,
infeasible suggestion are identified immediately. 

We remark that problems related to random recourse have to be cared about by the users, cf. \cite{walk}.

\section{Input files} \label{S:INP}

\texttt{ddsip} requires 3 input files, a number of other files are optional. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Specification file: a file containing the specifications of the
stochastic program, some CPLEX- and b\&b-parameters
\item Model file: a file readable by CPLEX (e.g. lp- or mps-format, possibly in gzipped form) that specifies the 
single-scenario model
\item Priority order file for subproblems (optional): a CPLEX order file corresponding to the
model file
\item RHS scenario file: a file containing the stochastic right-hand sides
and the probabilities of the scenarios 
\item Cost scenario file (optional): a file containing stochastic cost
coefficients 
\item Matrix scenario file (optional): a file containing stochastic
matrix entries
\item Priority order file for master (optional): a file containing a branching order for the master branch-and-bound
procedure  
\item Start information file (optional): a file containing start
informations such as a feasible solution and/or a lower bound
\end{itemize}
A comfortable way to invoke the program on a Unix system is the command 
\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent
~~ ddsip $<$ files2sip
\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent
where the file {\it files2sip} may contain the lines displayed in Figure~\ref{F:F2S}.

%
\section{The model file}
The model file contains the single-scenario model. Its format can be one of the formats readable by
\texttt{CPLEX}, as e.g.\ the lp- or mps-format. The gzipped forms of these files (with extensions .lp.gz or .mps.gz)
can be used for the sake of saving disk space. This is especially advisable in case OUTFILE is chosen greater than 2.\\
The first-stage variables have to be identified by a prefix or a postfix appended to their names
as specified in the specs file.\\
The requirements on the ordering of the variables and constraints from earlier ddsip versions are now obsolete.\\
The only requirement on the model file is that all first-stage variables are identified by a prefix or postfix appended to their names
which is specified in the specs file.
%
\section{The specification file}
Comments could be included anywhere in this file apart from the CPLEX parameter section.
An Asterisk identifies the beginning of a comment until the end of the line.
This way explanations could be included and parameter lines temporarily inactivated
Comments or commenting out lines could not be used within the CPLEX parameter section.

Keywords are accepted if their start matches the strings given in the tables.
Unknown keywords are simply ignored. Lines with the first occurrence of each keyword are evaluated.

A sample specification file is given in Appendix \ref{S:SAM}. %Figure~\ref{F:SPEC}.
\subsection{Parameters for the two-stage model}
Hopefully, the identifiers in the first part of the file are self explaining. Otherwise, they should
become clear when consulting the two-stage chapter of one of the standard text books on stochastic
programming, see \cite{bir,kal,pre}.

The parameters FIRSTVAR, FIRSTCON, SECVAR, SECCON  used in the older DDSIP versions are now obsolete.
These values and the corresponding indices of variables and constraints are now determined by the program
using the prefix or postfix specified.

Either a prefix or a postfix of the variable names for identifying the first-stage variables has to be specified.

%The default behaviour is to expect a postfix of the form ''01'' in their names.

%
\subsection{CPLEX parameters}
CPLEX parameters to be set different from their defaults have to be specified following a line with the indicator {\it CPLEXBEGIN}.\\
The contained lines have to start with the CPLEX parameter number followed by the parameter value. This can be followed by a comment, starting with an asterisk.
The parameter numbers are specified in the CPLEX callable library documentation, section parameter table.\\
The settings following directly the line with {\it CPLEXBEGIN} are applied to all problems solved.\\[0.5em]
Special settings for CPLEX parameters can be specified for the different stages of the program.\\
For the calculation of the EEV
parameter values can be overwritten after the identifier {\it CPLEXEEV},\\
for the evaluation of lower bounds after the identifier {\it CPLEXLB},\\
for a continuation of the evaluation of lower bounds with different settings after the identifier {\it CPLEX2UB},\\
for the evaluation of upper bounds after the identifier {\it CPLEXUB},\\
for a continuation of the evaluation of upper bounds with different settings after the identifier {\it CPLEX2UB},\\
for the subproblems of the Lagrangian dual after the identifier {\it CPLEXDUAL},\\
for a continuation of the subproblems of the Lagrangian dual after the identifier {\it CPLEX2DUAL}.\\[0.5em]
For some problems it is beneficial to use two optimization calls with different parameter setings (e.g. mip emphasis, heuristic frequency)
sequentially, the second one starting with the B\&B tree and solutions obtained in the first call. This is enabled for lower and upper bound calculations and the Lagrangean dual if the sections beginning 
with {\it CPLEX2LB}, {\it CPLEX2UB}, or  {\it CPLEX2DUAL} are specified.\\[0.5em]
The CPLEX parameter section has to end with the identifier {\it CPLEXEND}.
Parameters not present in the mentioned chapters are set according to their CPLEX default values,
cf. \cite{cp}. \\
Note that in the section between {\it CPLEXBEGIN} and  {\it CPLEXEND} there could be comments following the pair of numerical parameter identifier and value, but not whole lines could be comments, ie.e. 
no line should start with an asterisk.

%
\subsection{Parameters for the decomposition procedure}
The parameters that effect the amount of output and the termination behavior are listed in the table 
below. The first column of the table contains the name of the parameter, the second one
specifies whether it is an integer or a real (Dbl) parameter, and the last column explains the
parameter's meaning. 

The signal SIGTERM (as defined on LINUX/UNIX-environments) is handled by the program,
other signals are not handled separately. SIGTERM causes the termination of \texttt{ddsip} after 
solving the current subproblem. 

So far all termination parameters are static in the sense that they cannot be changed during the
branch-and-bound algorithm. Therefore, a careful trade-off between these parameters and the
termination parameters of the bundle method, see Section~\ref{SS:DUAL}, is essential for the
numerical performance, cf. \cite{cs2}.  \medskip  

Parameters that effect the behavior of the branch-and-bound algorithm are compiled in the
Tables~2 and ~3. The default values are marked with a star.
The use of start values is described in
Section~\ref{S:START}, the use of priority order information in Section~\ref{S:ORDER}.  The
parameter RELAXL effects the relaxation levels during the evaluation of lower bounds. It relates to
the scenario subproblems.

The {\it branching value} is used to create two new subproblems as described in {\em STEP 5} of the
decomposition algorithm. For continuous components it depends on the parameter EPSILON.

The dispersion norm of a node is calculated as $\max_{j}  \{  \max_{i}
x_{ij} - \min_{i} x_{ij}\}$ where $x_j$, $j=1,\ldots,S$, are the (first-stage part of the) solutions
of the $S$ subproblems and $x_{ij}$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, are their i-th components.
Nodes with a dispersion norm smaller than NULLDISP are considered as leaves of the 
B\&B tree (i.e. no further branching on them).

%\end{table}

The MAXINHERIT parameter specifies a maximal level of passing on solutions and bounds in the B\&B-tree
for the lower bound step.
This facility is interrupted by an invocation of the conic bundle algorithm, which will change the
Lagrangian multipliers. It saves half of the solutions of scenario problems, but in case these problems
are not solved to optimality the lower bound might be inferior to the one possibly obtained for the descendants
(with the addtional bounds on the variables branched on).
For this reason the level of inheritance can be bounded to the number
of branching steps specified with the \mbox{MAXINHERIT} keyword.

After the first node the scenarios are sorted descending wrt. their contribution to the expected value. 
This serves earlier detection of inferiority and allows stopping of evaluation of scenarios.\\
If conic bundle is used, the lower bound for each scenario is not fully reliable in upper bounding (which is done without Lagrangean parameters).
The parameter PREMATURE (default 1) to allow/disallow premature stopping in upper bounding can be set to 0 when conic bundle is used.

\subsection{Heuristic}
The decomposition algorithm uses a heuristic to guess feasible first-stage solutions based on the
solutions of the subproblems in the current node. The heuristic is set by means of the parameter
HEURIS. The possible values of HEURIS are listed in the following table.\\
More than one of the heuristics could be used sequentially in every node when specifying the value 99, followed by a
list of heuristics to be used, the specs file line could look like this:\\[0.5em]

In order to save time the order of evaluation of the scenario problems is changed if an infeasible one is encountered.
Since often the same scenarios gives infeasibility these ones are evaluated first in the sequel.
\subsection{Parameters for the risk model}
The parameters for the risk models are displayed below. Some parameter settings lead to
ill-posed models, cf. \cite{diss}. \texttt{ddsip} provides only limited consistency checks with this
respect.  

The same holds true for the choice of an algorithm. Algorithms similar to the scenario decomposition
as outlined above only apply to mean-risk models with {\it decomposable} linear risk measures. The
algorithm FSD can be used with any risk measure that is consistent with first-order stochastic
dominance. The weakest algorithm NFSD allows the minimization of any (nonlinear) risk measure. A
detailed description of the different algorithms can be found in \cite{diss}.

The program offers 7 different mean-risk models and the associated risk models, in which the expected
value is not minimized. In the following table we have compiled the possible settings.
%
%\begin{table}[ht]

Positive values of RISKMO implement the model $\min_X \limits \E X + \alpha \R X$, negative ones
the risk model $\min_X \limits \R X$. These pure risk models are often harder to solve.

For the (mean-)absolute semideviation model the TARGET has to be set less or equal the optimal expected value when using RISKALG 0 (cf. \cite{diss}).
%
\subsection{Parameters for the dual method} \label{SS:DUAL}
There is an online manual of \texttt{ConicBundle} available \cite{CB}. We refer also
to \cite{helm2} where the method is described in the context of semidefinite programming.
Below, we only explain the parameters defined in our implementation.

The dual method cannot be used in combination with the algorithm based on the FSD-consistency of the
risk measure, cf. \cite{diss}. The user has to take care about this detail. 

The use of stochastic cost coefficient in combination with the Lagrangian dual is not supported,
yet. We recommend to reformulate the problem by an additional variable and an additional constraint
representing the objective function. This leads to a stochastic matrix. 

The ConicBundle weight is changed between single dual steps under certain conditions by ConicBundle itself.
DDSIP offers the possibility to heuristically change (increase or decrease) the weight between descent steps.
By default this feature is turned on and could be deactivated by parameters.

\section{The scenario files}
Unfortunately, the program \texttt{ddsip} is not conform to the SMPS data format, yet. 
But in contrast to the SMPS format due to the requirements for the variable and constraint names and the input format for the stochstic coefficients no specific ordering is required in the model file.
The proprietary data format of the scenario files is described below.

Each file has to start with the keyword 'Names' followed by a list of the names of constraints for the stochastic right-hand sides, variables for the stochastic objective coefficients,
and pairs of names for constraint and variable for the stochastic matrix entries. These name lists determine the order of objects the coefficients in the different scenarios are
assigned.

The identifier {\it sce} indicates the begin of the entries for the next
scenario. Figure~\ref{F:SCRHS} displays the different scenario files.  
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
right-hand sides&cost coefficients& matrix entries \\ \hline
Names\hspace*{3cm}& Names\hspace*{3cm}& Names  \\ 
constr25 & var16 & cons5 var15\\
constr30 & var18 & cons5 var16\\
\vdots   & \vdots   & \vdots \\
scenario1\hspace*{3cm}& scenario1\hspace*{3cm}& scenario1  \\ 
0.1      & 23.1       &	   0.125 \\ 
12.12   & 33.33       &	   34	   \\
32.4     &          &               \\
\vdots   & \vdots   & \vdots \\
scenarioN& scenarioN&scenarioN \\
0.1      & 25.56    &	   30.3 	    \\ 
30.2       & 11.5       &	   22.56  \\
41.0       &          &\\
\vdots   & \vdots   &   \vdots    \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center} \caption{Format of the scenario files} \label{F:SCRHS} 
\end{figure}

In the right-hand side scenario file, the first number after the identifier is the scenario
probability. For problems without stochastic right-hand sides, this file has to contain only the
probabilities of the individual scenarios (and does not contain the `Names' keyword, but does have the {\it sce} 
keyword for each scenario followed on the next line by the probability).\\

In the cost coefficient scenario file the probability entries are left out. Otherwise the entries
are the same as those in the right-hand side scenario file, cf. Figure~\ref{F:SCRHS}.
The number of stochastic cost coefficients $c$ has to be specified in the
specification file. 

\section{Optional files}
\subsection{Start information file} \label{S:START}
Start information can be provided as displayed in Figure~\ref{F:START}.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}\framebox{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
BEST   &2345\\
BOUND  &2000\\

MULTIPLIER&\\
3&\\
4&\\
\vdots&
\end{tabular}}
\end{center} \caption{File with start values} \label{F:START}
\end{figure}
%
Hereby, BEST should be an upper bound, BOUND a lower bound, SOLUTION a feasible first-stage
solution, and MULTIPLIER a Lagrangian multiplier. Any item of these four different informations may be
left out.\\
The user has to care for the consistency of the data. 

\subsection{The priority order files} \label{S:ORDER}
If indicated by setting the CPLEX parameter CPX\_PARAM\_MIPORDIND, the name of a CPLEX branching order file to be used for the scenario
problems has to be specified following the name of the model file (named model.ord in Figure~2). Its format is described in the CPLEX manual.

{\it not functional by now, function is still to be adapted to the usage of names!}\\
If the parameter PORDER is set, a file with branching order information for the master problem has to be given (named order.dat in Figure~2).
The file has two columns whereby the first one contains {\bf names} of first-stage variables and
the second one integer values. High values lead to early branching.

The meaning of the single entries is rather straightforward. Here is a short
explanation. 

\noindent
\begin{tabbing}
Name\hspace*{1cm}\=Description \kill
Node\>gives the number of the currently solved node.\\
Nodes\>counts the number of nodes generated in the tree.\\
Left\>counts the number of nodes in the front tree.\\
Objective\>is the lower bound of the current node. \\
Heuristic\>is the upper bound returned by the heuristic. \\
Best Value\> is the overall upper bound.\\
Bound\> is the overall lower bound.\\
Viol.\> is the number of variables violationg the nonanticipativity.\\
Dispersion\> is the greatest difference of first-stage variable values.\\
Gap\> is the relative gap between {\it Best Value} and {\it Bound}.\\
Wall Time\> gives the wall time passed since invoking the program.\\
CPU Time\> gives the CPU time passed since invoking the program.\\
Father\> gives the number of the father node.\\
\end{tabbing}

The pruning of nodes is indicated by the entry {\it cutoff} in the row `Objective'. 
The row `Heuristic' may also contain the entries {\it n-stop} (inferiority, evaluation stopped at
n-th scenario) or {\it multiple} (a solution has been evaluated previously). When more than one
solution is evaluated in a branch-and-bound step, the entry indicates the status of the last
solution.

An asterisk in the first position indicates that a new best value was found.
In the example a list of heuristics is used in every node, the lines beginning with an asterisk
indicate which heuristic found a new best solution.
If the scenario solutions of a node fulfil the nonanticipativiy and yield
a new best upper bound, in the output line for the node an asterisk is prepended, too.

\subsection{Other output files}
The number of additional output files and their content is ruled via the parameters OUTFIL and
OUTLEV. Values of OUTFIL greater than 1 are intended for debugging purposes.
\begin{itemize}
\item The file {\it more.out} contains more or less information depending on the parameter OUTLEV,
e.g. the subproblem solutions, the branch-and-bound tree, and the objective function composition. 
\item The file {\it solution.out} contains information on the solution with the optimal first-stage
solution among them. It is not written when OUTFILES is set to 0.
%\item
%The file {\it recfun.out} contains the sample points of the recourse function.
\item If OUTFILES is greater than 1, then in addition the following files are written to sipout:
\begin{itemize}
\item The files {\it rhs.out}, {\it cost.out}, {\it matrix.out}, and {\it model.lp.gz} offer a check
for a correct reading of the scenario files and the model file, respectively. 
\item The files {\it risk.lp.gz} and {\it eev.lp.gz} document the changes made during 
defining the risk model and solving the expected value problem, respectively. 
\end{itemize}
\item If OUTFILES equals 3, then in addition the following files are written to sipout:
\begin{itemize}
\item The  single scenario files {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n0\_gc*.lp.gz} and {\it ub\_sc\_*\_n0\_gc*.lp.gz} solved in the root node for lower and upper bounds, respectively.
\end{itemize}
\item If OUTFILES equals 4, then in addition the following files are written to sipout:
\begin{itemize}
\item The  single scenario files {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_gc*.lp.gz} and {\it ub\_sc\_*\_n*\_gc*.lp.gz} solved in all nodes for lower and upper bounds.
\end{itemize}
\item If OUTFILES equals 5, then the files  {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_gc*.lp.gz} and\\  {\it ub\_sc\_*\_n*\_gc*.lp.gz} are not written, but instead
\begin{itemize}
\item The single scenario files {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*.sav.gz} solved in all nodes for lower bounds plus the used MIP starts as {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*.mst.gz} and
 the CPLEX settings as {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_1.prm} and {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_2.prm}. In the case of conic bundle use these are overwritten in every dual step,
 just the ones of the final dual step of each node (or the one causing a program crash) remain.
\end{itemize}
\item If OUTFILES equals 6, as in the case 5 the single scenario problem files are not written as lp.gz, but instead
\begin{itemize}
\item The single scenario files {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_gc*.sav.gz} solved in all nodes for lower bounds plus the used MIP starts as {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_gc*.mst.gz} and
 the CPLEX settings as {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_1.prm} and {\it lb\_sc\_*\_n*\_2.prm}.
 This is the same amount of output files as with the setting 5 in case no conic bundle is used.
 In the case of conic bundle use these are written in every dual step, increasing the value after gc (global counter) with each step.
