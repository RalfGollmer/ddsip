makefile in the DDSIP directory currently is a symbolic link to makefile.debug_Core2_x64,
which compiles for a pre-i7 Core2 processor with optimization settings.
Set the link to a makefile with compiler options in PROCESSOR which best fit your machine
or edit these settings accordingly.

The makefiles with 'debug' in their name use no code optimization and the option '-g' for debugging purposes.

DDSIP depends on installations of CPLEX and Christoph Helmberg's Conic Bundle.
The location of these programs is defined in the makefile in three macros:

CPLEX     - the loction of directory cplex in your installation
LINUXVAR  - the name of the subdirectory under cplex/lib (which changes with installation and CPLEX version)

CB        - the root directory of your installation of Conic Bundle (containing the subdirectories include and lib)

The current version CB_v0.3.11.tgz produces some uninitialized reads of memory allocated within CB.
I added an initializaton of allocated memory in the Conic Bundle code. The file Matrix/memarray.cxx
contains the change I applied to $(CB)/Matrix/memarray.cxx.

The choice for the macro MODE in the Makefile for Conic Bundle (OPTI or DEBUG) should be made according to
the intended version of DDSIP (optimized or debug) before issuing the make command for Conic Bundle.

Then call 'make' in the DDSIP directory.
The name of the executable is set in the makefiles differently, indicating the version used.

DDSIP can be compiled without usage of Conic Bundle when the macro definition -DCONIC_BUNDLE
is deleted from your makefile. If the macro CONIC_BUNDLE is not defined, this disables all parts
of the program depending on the Conic Bundle package.
